Created a user friendly dictionary on python.
First it will take the input of the word and give it's meaning , if it's a list it will iterate over and print line by line else it will just print one line.
Code is very simple and i added comments which will help you understand the code.
T used get_close_match function from difflib module which help me get the word looking similar to the user user typed. incase! if user type the word wong by mistakenly or type a wrong speeling.
The data.json file contains all the words nearly 50,000 words and it's meaning. it contains the text in the way that our dictionary data structure comprehend so when we import it and assign it to our object it will automaticaly convert into dictionary.
Our dictionary object contains all the words and it's meaning of english language.
Later it it's ask you if you wanna see the meaning of another word else you will wuit the terminal.
You can fork it or either just clone it get into your PC/mac and just run it in your python IDLE and it will worked.
